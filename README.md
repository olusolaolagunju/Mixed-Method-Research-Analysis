# Effect of Human Development Index on  Covid-19 Infection Rate, Case Fatality Rate nd  Vaccination Rate: A descriptive model and mixed method research analysis
## Abstract
### Objectives

This study estimated the effect of human development index and other selected independent variables on the Covid-19 infection rate (IFR), case fatality rate (CFR), and vaccination rate (VR) outcomes with an emphasis on Africa. Also, the study examined the individual perception of the Covid-19 vaccine on the vaccination rate in the African context.

### Methodology

In this mixed method analysis, I used a descriptive quantitative statistical method to obtain and compare the Covid-19 average IFR, CFR, and VR across all six continents and tested each continent's means for significant differences with a one-way Anova test. Then I performed a correlation test to find the relationship between the dependent IFR, CFR, and VR variables and the independent variables, followed by a Regression analysis modeling to determine the significant effect of the independent variables on the dependent variables. Also, I adopted a thematic analysis framework to extract the essential themes from the qualitative interview study about individual perceptions of the covid-19 vaccine in Ethiopia.

### Result

There were significant differences among continents' IFR, CFR and VR, and Africa had the lowest infection and vaccination rates and the second highest case fatality rate. Countries' median age and the human development index influenced the IFR and independently accounted for the most IFR variations, 55% and 58%, respectively, across all continents. The percentage of countries' Covid-19 positive rates and human development index were the only independent variables that contributed to the CFR but accounted for only 14% of the CFR variations. To my knowledge, no article has published these variables as significant factors associated with the case fatality rate. However, countries' median age, human development index, and life expectancy index caused more than 50% variations in the VR. I obtained two major themes from the qualitative study. There was inadequate information about the Covid-19 vaccine, and there were safety concerns about the future side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine

### Conclusion 
The country's human development index was the only independent variable responsible for the highest variations in the infection rate, case fatality rate and vaccination rate. Africa has the lowest human development index, thus explaining the reason for the low infection and vaccination rate and high case fatality rate. Inadequate Covid-19 vaccine information and safety concerns contributed to the low vaccination rate in Ethiopia.
