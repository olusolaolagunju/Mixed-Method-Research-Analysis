# Mixed-Method-Research-Analysis
## Abstract
### Bcakground
There have been speculations about the reason for the high case fatality rate in Africa despite having low infection rate. Here, I attempted to identify whether other factors aside the median age affected the case fatality rate, infection rate and also the vaccination rate

### Objective
I estimated and compared the means of the Covid-19 infection rate (IFR), case fatality rate (CFR), and vaccination rate per continent (VR). Also, tested the hypothesis about Covid-19 infection rate been influenced by continent's median age. To determine the factors influencing the CFR, I determined the correlation between two independent variables, gross domestic product per population and median age and the dependent variable, case fatality rate and determined if they can be used to predict case fatality rate. Lastly, I use qualitative analysis to determine the reason for the low vaccination rate in Africa.
 
 
### Methodology
In this mixed method analysis, I used descriptive quantitative statistical analysis to obtain and compare the means of  Covid-19 IFR, CFR, and VR across all seven continents and tested their means for significant differences with a one-way Anova test. Then, I used Pearson correlation to determine the relationship between the dependent variables (IFR, CFR, and VR) and the independent variables (median age and the gross domestic product per population independent), followed by a Regression analysis. I determined the significant effect of the independent variables on the dependent variables. lastly, I used thematic analysis to extract major themes from the qualitative interview study about individual perceptions of the covid-19 vaccine in Ethiopia. 

### Result
My analysis confirmed that Africa has the lowest infection rate and vaccination rates. I found out that the median age significantly influences only the IFR, while the independent variables, median age, and Gdp/pop have no significant effect on CFR and the VR. Although, the median age have strong correlations with the vaccination rate. My qualitative analysis showed that inadequate Covid-19 vaccine information and the perception that the Covid-19 vaccine is meant for only elderly people and healthcare workers are the major themes influencing Africa vaccination rate and could be the reason for the low vaccination rate

### Conclusion 
Africa's low infection rate is due to low median age, while median age and gross domestic product per population have no significant effect on the case fatality rate. Although, the individual perception in the African context, is responsible for the low vaccination rate.
 
## Introduction
Since COVID-19 became a pandemic, projection models were developed for Africa, with the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 has an exponential pattern of transmission (Ghosh et al 2020).  However, the projection was false as the population affected remains to be the least by global standard (Gesesew et al., 2021) except for south Africa which has been disappointedly affected by Covid-19. It was first hypothesized that the tropical climate of most African countries offered protection from Covid-19 (Sajadi et al., 2020, Hossain, 2020). It was also assumed that the covid-19 slow spread was due to the low response of ACE inhibitors in individuals of African ancestry (Ortiz-Fern√°ndez et al., 2020, Brewster et al., 2021).  ACE-2 gene encodes angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), the receptor for SARS-CoV2. Additionally, the prolonged co-occurrence and exposure of Africans to fatal infections such as malaria, chicken pox, tuberculosis, and measles elevates allelic frequencies and could confer protection against infectious diseases (Ghosh et al, 2020). 
This analysis estimated the average infection rate, case fatality rate, and vaccination rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) per continent as well as determined the individual perception of the Covid-19 vaccine and its effect on the Covid-19 vaccination rate in Africa.


## Methodology
I used two open-source datasets for this study. The first was the covid-19 case, death, and vaccine dataset obtained from [Wold-in-data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) and the second was a qualitative interview study dataset obtained from [figshare]( https://bit.ly/3TyvMTW). I used a  descriptive analysis to compute the average infection rate (IFR), case fatality rate (CFR), and vaccination rate (VR) per continent. I calculated the the IFR calculated as the percentage ratio of cases per population, the CFR as the percentage ratio of deaths per case, and the VR as the percentage ratio of the number of people that have received at least a single dose of covid-19 vaccine per population. I tested the means of IFR, CFR, and VR  for significant differences across continents with a one-way Anova test. while I used Pearson correlation to test the relationship between the dependent IFR, CFR, and VR variables and median age and GDP/POP independent variables. Also, I use a regression analysis to determine the significant effect of the independent variables on the dependent variables. Lastly, I used a thematic analysis to extract major themes from the qualitative interview study about individual perceptions of the covid-19 vaccine in Ethiopia


## Result and Discussion
### Infection rate (IFR)
My study showed a significant differences in the mean of Infection rates across the seven continents at p < 0.0001. The median age played a significant role in the mean differences as Africa recorded the lowest infection rate (Figure 1).
